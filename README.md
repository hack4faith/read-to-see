## #Read-to-See - A Reading Path for Discovering God's Master Plan

*Read the Bible? Where do I even start? What if you had a suggested reading 'short-list' to help get started?*

Have you ever wanted to get to the core understanding on something and you step into a library or book store or even do an internet search and are overwhelmed with the question, where do I even start? Many times in our approach to wanting to understand more about God, we are overwhelmed even if we have a Bible in hand. The Bible too is like a library, consisting of 66 books with a variety of authors and two sections -- an old part (39 books) and a new part (27 books) -- where does one start? To get started, sometimes we simply need someone that has been down the path before to come alongside. Someone to share a suggested reading 'short-list' that points us in a direction where we can see the core concepts and lay a foundation for future deeper study and understanding. 

This **#Read-to-See** plan provides a 'short-list' reading path (11 books not all 66) through which you can discover God's Master Plan for all time, how Jesus is at the heart of it, and how God has provided the way for you to be included in it too! 

Read through these 11 books like you'd read any series of books, becoming familiar with the various characters and letting the unfolding story engage you. It's not a time for deep study, simply #Read-to-See God's great and unfolding master plan for all things and how He sees you.

# The #Read-to-See Short-list:

*Laying the foundation –* Jesus, His life was His message and His message and life now lives in His believers.
1. Luke – *Seeing* Jesus.
1. Acts – *Seeing* the Good News of Jesus go viral.
1. Colossians – *Seeing* the majesty of Jesus transform daily living.

*Tying the Old Testament with the New –* Jesus and the plan of redemption are at the heart of both.
1. Genesis - *Seeing* the source of all things from the physical to the spiritual. And seeing God's loving promise provide the master plan for redemption and make a way for a faith-life.
1. Exodus - *Seeing* slaves become a nation through which God provides the historic and prophetic context to bring Jesus into the world.
1. Hebrews - *Seeing* the Old Testament in light of the majesty of Jesus - Jesus was/is the agent of God's Master Plan.

*Receiving encouragement* from those who walked with and knew Jesus before and after His death and resurrection and went on to live a faith-filled life for Him.  Here we see what was important enough for each of these to be writing about at the end of their life -- this encourages our faith-life and shapes how we see ourself influencing the present.
1. 1 John - *Seeing* yourself immersed in the love of God. 
1. 1 Peter - *Seeing* yourself content with your integrity firmly rooted in Christ.
1. 2 Peter - *Seeing* yourself mature, fully complete in God, able to endure all things.
1. James - *Seeing* yourself genuine in faith, words, actions and prayer.

*Revealing the majesty of Jesus* in the reconciliation of all things in heaven and on earth.
1. Revelation - *Seeing* the result of God's Master Plan - His plan is to have you with Him.


Our prayer is that the **#Read-to-See** short-list provides the lens of God's Master Plan, mankind reconciled through Jesus, through which to see each book of the Bible you will go on to read and study. 
	
As the Apostle Paul says, *"…There’s nothing like the written Word of God for showing you the way to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. Every part of Scripture is God-breathed and useful one way or another—showing us truth, exposing our rebellion, correcting our mistakes, training us to live God’s way. Through the Word we are put together and shaped up for the tasks God has for us." 2 Timothy 3:14-17, The Message*
